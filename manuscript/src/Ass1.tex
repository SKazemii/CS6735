\section*{Introduction}
\vspace{2cm}
This project has focused on comparing and discussing five various machine learning algorithms based on the experimental results on the five different datasets. Furthermore, this research will be implemented in Python, and the source codes are available on the GitHub \href{https://github.com/SKazemii/CS6735}{ repository}. 

The rest of this assignment is organized as follows. Section 1 provides some information about the dataset along with techniques that are used for pre-processing. Then, in Section 2, the machine learning algorithms will be reviewed. Finally, the results are discussed in Section 3.

\section*{The Questions}
{\small
Conduct an experimental study on the following machine learning algorithms: (1) ID3; (2) Adaboost on ID3; (3) Random Forest; (4) Na√Øve Bayes; (5) K-nearest neighbors (kNN).


\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement the five algorithms using Java or Python.
\item Evaluate your implementation on the datasets in data.zip (downloadable from course website) using 10 times 5-fold cross-validation, and report the average accuracy and standard deviation. All datasets are for UCI machine learning repository. You can check the detailed descriptions from this 
\href{http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html}{ link.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item For breast cancer data see this \href{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+\%28Diagnostic\%29}{ link.}
    \item For car data see this \href{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation}{ link.} 
    \item For ecoli data see this \href{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ecoli}{ link.}
    \item For letter recognition data see this \href{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition}{ link.}
    \item For mushroom data see this \href{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom}{ link.} 
\end{itemize}

For each data set, there is a target variable, the one your model predicts. The following are the target variable for each data set.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mushroom: first column (e, p)
    \item Letter: first column (A, B, ...)
    \item Ecoli: last column (cp, im, ..)
    \item Car: last column (acc, uacc, ..)
    \item Breast-cancer: last column (2, 4)
\end{itemize}

\item Compare and discuss your algorithms (implementations) based on your experimental results. 

\textbf{Submission:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hand in a report of your experimental study via Desire2Learning, including:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Description of the learning algorithms you implement.
\item Description of the datasets you use (number of examples, number of attribute, number of classes, type of attributes, etc.).
\item Technical details of your implementation: pre-processing of data sets (discretization, etc.), parameter setting, etc. 
\item Design of your programming implementation (data structures, overall program structure).
\item Report and analysis of your experimental results. 
\end{enumerate}

\item Submit your code via Desire2Learning.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
